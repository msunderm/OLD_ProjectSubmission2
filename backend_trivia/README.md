# Project - Trivia API
## Introduction 
Backend - Trivia API is made for a trivia. The application must be able to display questions but also delete or add new questions. Questions should be searchable by category or based on a text string. Finally, there is a quiz game that can be played.

## Getting started
- Base URL: this backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is sat as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: this application does not require any authentication 


## Error handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format: 
```
{
  "success": False,
  "error": 400,
  "message": "bad request"
}
```

The API will return the folowing error types when the request fails: 
- 400: bad request
- 404: resource not found
- 405: method not allowed
- 422: unprocessable
